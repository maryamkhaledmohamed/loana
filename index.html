                New green regulations, pressure from consumers and stakeholders, changes in supply chain after the pandemic have resulted in decision makers in businesses large and small becoming more<strong> open to implementing sustainability, circular or regenerative principles.</strong>This
                is a time of <strong> huge opportunity for entrepreneurs and consultants that offer </strong>these type of services.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, growth and scaling up are not always a straightforward journey. Having a marketing strategy that gives <strong>focus, clarity of action and deliver against business objectives</strong> plays a fundamental role.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my work of building marketing growth strategies with sustainability entrepreneurs, I’ve seen a fair share of mistakes, best practices, and success factors.
            </p>
            <p>

                In this article I uncover 3 principles that sustainability business can use to build a successful growth marketing strategy that delivers against their business and impact objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1) Set <strong>actionable</strong> business <span style="color: #3e1ddf; font-weight: bold;">OBJECTIVES.</span></li>
                <li>2) Use a sustainability <span style="color: #3e1ddf; font-weight: bold;">MESSAGE </span> <strong>engages.</strong></li>
                <li>3) Build a <strong>predictable</strong> <span style="color: #3e1ddf; font-weight: bold;">SYSTEM</span> to acquire clients.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h5>1.Set actionable business <span class="red">Objectives</span></h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                When it comes to growth, most businesses in the sustainability space or beyond often think solely in terms of revenue. This however is not actionable enough when it comes to building an effective
                <strong>growth marketing strategy.</strong> It can result in generic, off-the-shelf marketing activities, which in turn leads to underwhelming results.
            </p>
            <p>
                To gear your marketing machine towards growth, you need to have a clear idea of <strong>how many businesses you want to transform and how this is going to happen</strong> (e.g. attracting new clients, launching a new service, expanding
                into a new country etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, <strong>an additional revenue of £200k could mean either 2 more corporate clients or 200 small businesses.</strong> These require 2 different strategies to engage and convert into clients. The sustainability message, channels,
                approach and marketing assets are very different as they need to cater to different decision makers’ needs and sales cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get clarity on how many clients you need to grow your business and your impact. Then work backwards to build a coherent marketing strategy that will deliver against your growth objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach will help you focus your efforts and budget on the <strong>few marketing activities that truly matter</strong> instead of hustling with different marketing tactics to see what works.

            <h5>2. Use a <span class="red">Sustainability Message </span> that engages </h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Most decision makers lack an understanding of how to implement sustainability in their business and struggle with the myriad of concepts and solutions. They often want to do something, but they are not sure what and how to go about it.
            </p>
            <p>

                Sustainability entrepreneurs, in their excitement of changing the world, often forget that <strong>not everyone has their knowledge and enthusiasm</strong> . Hence they make some common mistakes that can lower the engagement and conversion:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-ul">

                <li> <strong style="color: #290cb5 ;"> <span class="cir"></span> Using a message that is not clear enough </strong>- a confused mind cannot decide</li>
                <br>

                <li><strong style="color: #290cb5 ;"><span class="cir"></span>Using too much technical language and sustainability jargon</strong>- as opposed to examples, simple stories, simple infographics and images</li>
                <br>

                <li><strong style="color: #290cb5 ;"><span class="cir"></span>Overwhelming decision makers with a lot of information </strong>- instead of starting small and building up as they become interested</li>
                <br>

                <li><strong style="color: #290cb5 ;"><span class="cir"></span>Not adapting to the knowledge and language of the audience - </strong>eg. Head of Sustainability vs CEO</li>


            </ul>
            <p>
                All these result in decision makers not engaging with the message or opting for <strong>“we do not have the budget” or “it is not a priority”</strong> after a meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                You want to create a message that is clear, uses your audience’s language and is adapted to the stages that the decision makers go through to become your clients: awareness, interest, trial etc

            <hr>
            <p>
                Spending hours on posting about sustainability or chasing decision makers is a “hustle strategy” that is acceptable when you just get started with your business. But if you want to scale up, increase your impact and bring sustainability solutions to as
                many individuals and businesses as possible, the hustle approach will not work.

            </p>
            <p>
                Businesses that <strong>scale up successfully have in place a client acquisition system.</strong> They know where the next client will be coming from, how to attract and engage the right decision makers, what to say and when to make them
                go “Yes, let’s do it”.
            </p>
            <p>

                When working with my clients, we create <strong>bespoke client attraction systems</strong> by answering the type of questions below. You can use them as inspiration and start creating your own. Just know that there is no ‘one size fits
                all’ system, it has to be right for you.
